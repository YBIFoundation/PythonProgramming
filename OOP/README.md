# **Object Oriented Programming**

The books and other publications, which a library offers, are like the data in an object-oriented program. 
Access to the books is restricted like access to the data is restricted in OOP. 
Getting or returning a book is only possible via the staff. 
The staff functions like the methods in OOP, which control the access to the data. So, the data, - often called **attributes**, - 
in such a program can be seen as being hidden and protected by a shell, and it can only be accessed by special functions, usually called **methods** in the OOP context. 
Putting the data behind a "shell" is called **Encapsulation**. So a library can be regarded as a **class** and a book is an **instance or an object** of this class. 
Generally speaking, an object is defined by a class. A class is a formal description of how an object is designed, i.e. which attributes and methods it has. 
These objects are called instances as well. The expressions are in most cases used synonymously. 
A class should not be confused with an object.
